Here are a few suggestions to improve the syntax and code structure of your model:\n\n1. Add a schema.yml file: It's a good practice to include a schema.yml file for each model. This file defines the columns, their data types, and any constraints, making it easier for other users to understand the structure of your model.\n\n2. Use a more descriptive name: Instead of `my_second_dbt_model`, consider using a more descriptive name that reflects the purpose of the model. For example, if this model is used to filter data from `my_first_dbt_model`, you could name it something like `filtered_my"]</p>

This will make the model more flexible and easier to maintain in case the source table name changes or if you want to switch to a different source table.\n\n```\n{{\n  config(\n    materialized = 'view'\n  )\n}}\n\nSELECT *\nFROM {{ ref('some_table') }}\nWHERE id = 1\n```\n\n2. Consider adding a schema.yml file to your project to define the schema of the source table. This will help ensure that your model is always using the latest schema of the source table and help avoid errors due to schema changes.\n\n3. Instead of using `select *"]</p>

Instead of hardcoding the table name in your model, consider using the `ref` function to reference the source data from a separate source model. This will help keep your code flexible and maintainable over time.\n\n2. Consider adding a schema and table name to your source data. This will help ensure that your data is organized and easy to access.\n\n3. Consider adding comments to your model to describe what it is doing and any assumptions or caveats about the data.\n\n4. Consider using a `when` clause in your `union all` statement to ensure that only valid rows are included in your source']</p>
